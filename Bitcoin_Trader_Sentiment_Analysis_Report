Bitcoin Trader Sentiment Analysis — Project
 Report
 1. Project Overview & Motivation
 • Analyzing Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) provides powerful insights into trader
 psychology.
 • Correlating sentiment with trader performance metrics (PnL, leverage, trade sizes) helps
 uncover patterns for smarter strategies.
 2. Data Sources
 • Bitcoin Market Sentiment Dataset: Contains Date and Classification (Fear/Greed).
 • Hyperliquid Trader Dataset: Includes account, symbol, size, side, leverage, time, closedPnL,
 etc.
 3. Methodology
 • Data ingestion and cleaning with column normalization and date parsing.
 • Exploratory analysis: missing values, distributions, correlations.
 • Feature engineering: rolling stats, lagged sentiment, leverage metrics.
 • Modeling: classification for profitability, regression for PnL trends.
 • Visualizations: Boxplots, leverage trends, scatter of size vs PnL.
 4. Results & Key Insights
 • Evaluated metrics: accuracy, F1-score, regression R².
 • Identified key drivers such as leverage, trade size, and sentiment state.
 • Fear vs Greed regimes showed clear differences in profitability and risk.
 • High leverage in Greed phases correlated with higher losses.
 5. Benefits / Impacts
 • Provides practical signals to optimize trading strategies.
 • Framework for real-time strategy development.
 • Demonstrates full data-to-insight pipeline for financial ML projects.
 6. Next Steps
 • Backtesting trading rules based on derived insights.
 • Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation for stronger models.
 • Integration into real-time trading bots or monitoring dashboards.
